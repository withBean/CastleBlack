## Ten Thousand Ships

> My favorite part of the book.

THE LAST OF the great migrations into Westeros happened long after the
coming of the First Men and the Andals. Once the Ghiscari wars had ended,
the dragonlords of Valyria turned their gaze toward the west, where the
growth of Valyrian power brought the Freehold and its colonies into conflict
with the peoples of the Rhoyne.

The mightiest river in the world, the Rhoyne’s many tributaries stretched
across much of western Essos. Along their banks had arisen a civilization and
culture as storied and ancient as the Old Empire of Ghis. The Rhoynar had
grown rich off the bounty of their river; Mother Rhoyne, they named her.

Fishers, traders, teachers, scholars, workers in wood and stone and metal,
they raised their elegant towns and cities from the headwaters of the Rhoyne
down to her mouth, each lovelier than the last. There was Ghoyan Drohe in
the Velvet Hills, with its groves and waterfalls; Ny Sar, the city of fountains,
alive with song; Ar Noy on the Qhoyne, with its halls of green marble; pale
Sar Mell of the flowers; sea-girt Sarhoy with its canals and saltwater gardens;
and Chroyane, greatest of all, the festival city with its great Palace of Love.

Art and music flourished in the cities of the Rhoyne, and it is said their
people had their own magic—a water magic very different from the sorceries
of Valyria, which were woven of blood and fire. Though united by blood and
culture and the river that had given them birth, the Rhoynish cities were
elsewise fiercely independent, each with its own prince … or princess, for
amongst these river folk, women were regarded as the equals of men.

By and large a peaceful people, the Rhoynar could be formidable when roused
to wroth, as many a would-be Andal conqueror learned to his sorrow. The
Rhoynish warrior with his silver-scaled armor, fish-head helm, tall spear, and
turtle-shell shield was esteemed and feared by all those who faced him in
battle. It was said the Mother Rhoyne herself whispered to her children of
every threat, that the Rhoynar princes wielded strange, uncanny powers, that
Rhoynish women fought as fiercely as Rhoynish men, and that their cities
were protected by “watery walls” that would rise to drown any foe.

For many centuries the Rhoynar lived in peace. Though many a savage
people dwelt in the hills and forests around Mother Rhoyne, all knew better
than to molest the river folk. And the Rhoynar themselves showed little
interest in expansion; the river was their home, their mother, and their god,
and few of them wished to dwell beyond the sound of her eternal song.

---
When adventurers, exiles, and traders from the Freehold of Valyria began
to expand beyond the Lands of the Long Summer in the centuries after the
fall of the Old Empire of Ghis, the Rhoynish princes embraced them at first,
and their priests declared that all men were welcome to share the bounty of
Mother Rhoyne.

As those first Valyrian outposts grew into towns, and those towns into
cities, however, some Rhoynar came to regret the forbearance of their fathers.
Amity gave way to enmity, particularly upon the lower river, where the
ancient city of Sar Mell and the walled Valyrian town Volon Therys faced
each other across the waters, and on the shores of the Summer Sea, where the
Free City of Volantis soon rivaled the storied port of Sarhoy, each of them
commanding one of Mother Rhoyne’s four mouths.
