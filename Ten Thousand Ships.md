## Ten Thousand Ships

> My favorite part of the book.

THE LAST OF the great migrations into Westeros happened long after the
coming of the First Men and the Andals. Once the Ghiscari wars had ended,
the dragonlords of Valyria turned their gaze toward the west, where the
growth of Valyrian power brought the Freehold and its colonies into conflict
with the peoples of the Rhoyne.

The mightiest river in the world, the Rhoyne’s many tributaries stretched
across much of western Essos. Along their banks had arisen a civilization and
culture as storied and ancient as the Old Empire of Ghis. The Rhoynar had
grown rich off the bounty of their river; Mother Rhoyne, they named her.

Fishers, traders, teachers, scholars, workers in wood and stone and metal,
they raised their elegant towns and cities from the headwaters of the Rhoyne
down to her mouth, each lovelier than the last. There was Ghoyan Drohe in
the Velvet Hills, with its groves and waterfalls; Ny Sar, the city of fountains,
alive with song; Ar Noy on the Qhoyne, with its halls of green marble; pale
Sar Mell of the flowers; sea-girt Sarhoy with its canals and saltwater gardens;
and Chroyane, greatest of all, the festival city with its great Palace of Love.

Art and music flourished in the cities of the Rhoyne, and it is said their
people had their own magic—a water magic very different from the sorceries
of Valyria, which were woven of blood and fire. Though united by blood and
culture and the river that had given them birth, the Rhoynish cities were
elsewise fiercely independent, each with its own prince … or princess, for
amongst these river folk, women were regarded as the equals of men.
