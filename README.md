Winter is com'in

Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.

// 凛冬将至，我从今开始复习，至考方休。我将不求职、不出国、不保研。我将不耽玩乐，不猎美色。我将悬梁刺股，生死於斯。我是图书馆的雕像，自习室的幽灵。我是唤醒黎明的闹钟，闪耀午夜的台灯，守望课本的双眼，追寻知识的灵魂。我将生命与希望献给考研，日日如此，考上为止。
